       "'This is where grown ups come to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nTucked away above Short\\'s, Clinton St. is a wonderful find here in Iowa City. The ambiance is great, with a retro warehouse feel and beautiful views out onto the Pentacrest. Their real attraction is the drinks list: many interesting cocktails, my personal favorite being the Grandpa\\'s Coffin (bourbon, scotch, locally made apple brandy, and bitters). They also have a \"Murderer\\'s Row\" of high-end whiskey should that strike your fancy. I\\'d say this place competes with Devotay for best cocktails in Iowa City. They also have a well-chosen, if small, beer list, and I have had good times with their wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food has been very good. Last night, I had their smoked salmon nicoise salad, which had excellent flavor, and my wife had a tasty vegetarian quiche. They used to carry a really flavorful veggie burger, but appear to have dropped that from the menu within the past couple of months. On another visit, the salmon entr√©e was also good, though less memorable than the nicoise salad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s neat about this place is that it\\'s consciously striving to be a new cultural hub downtown. During a visit for Mission Creek I saw that they hosted jazz and poetry readings. They also have darts and pool tables off in side rooms, in a perfect environment for that kind of thing. I see lots of young professionals and UI faculty here, to give an indication of clientele. I will be returning, frequently.'"
